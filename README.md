# 2024 Antweight robot workshop

Organized at [Kaunas Makerspace](https://makerspace.lt) in October 2024.

DIY Antweight Robot designed for an inexpensive workshop that introduces
soldering & robotics to beginners. It's fun to assemble in a group and then
fight in an arena. The robot follows Lithuanian Antweight format - 200 g weight.

The robot is controlled via a website, which uses the Web Bluetooth API to connect to ESP32.
Best results with Google Chrome, works only in Android or laptops.

Total cost of everything (if you source 1 cell lithium battery yourself) - around 15eur.
